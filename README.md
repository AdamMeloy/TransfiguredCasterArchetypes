# Transfigured Caster Archetypes
*Creating Those Weird Archetypes People Probably Wanted?*

### [✗] Living Grimoire (Inquisitor Archetype)  
         -Blessed Script - Adds Additional Spell Slots of 1-4th level, instead of SLAs.  
         -Homebrew Option: Mindful - Allows the Wielder to use INT in place of STR for damage rolls on the Holy Book.  

### [✗] Other Archetypes  
Living Grimoire is currently the only archetype I plan to add. After finishing the game, I might come back to add more.
