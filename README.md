# Transfigured Caster Archetypes
*Creating Those Weird Archetypes People Probably Wanted?*

### [:heavy_check_mark:] Living Grimoire (Inquisitor Archetype)  
Blessed Script - Adds Additional Spell Slots of 1-4th level, instead of SLAs.  
Homebrew Option: Mindful - Allows the Wielder to use INT in place of STR for damage rolls with the Holy Book.  
(Applying the Enchantments from Sacred Word can be wonky. Spam-click them and it *should* work.)  

### [:x:] Other Archetypes  
Living Grimoire is currently the only archetype I have added. I might come back to add more after experiencing more than the first few hours of the game.
